	Version v0.0.1
	Name Singularity Container to run synthea on QCOE Cluster

%help
	This container contains a modified synthea jar file. The idea is to be able to run the synthea
	generator in environments where java is not installed and where it is impossible or 
	difficult to obtain root access but which already have singularity installed.

	All the options which will be passed to synthea are also valid. Please see https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Basic-Setup-and-Running#running-syntheatm for details on valid configuration options.

	When running this container, it is best to mount a directory where the output files would be stored.
